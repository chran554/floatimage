= floatimage

This is image implementations based on float64 and float32 values for image channels RGBA.

Images are RGB with alpha or premultiplied alpha.

* NRGBAF64 - RGB image with _ordinary alpha_ (non premultiplied). All channels are encoded as a 64 bit float value (per pixel).
* NRGBAF32 - RGB image with _ordinary alpha_ (non premultiplied). All channels are encoded as a 32 bit float value (per pixel).
* RGBAF64 - RGB image with _premultiplied alpha_. All channels are encoded as a 64 bit float value (per pixel).
* RGBAF32 - RGB image with _premultiplied alpha_. All channels are encoded as a 32 bit float value (per pixel).
