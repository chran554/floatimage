This is image implementations based on float64 and float32 values for image channels RGBA.

Images are RGB with alpha or premultiplied alpha channels. All channels are 64 or 32 bit float values. Expected value range for each channel is [0.0, 1.0]. Nothing stops the channel values to be outside the valid value interval but any call to the Color interface function `RGBA() (r, g, b, a uint32)` will clamp the values to the valid range.

All image formats are backed by an accompanying color model.

* NRGBAF64 - Color and RGB image with _ordinary alpha_ (non premultiplied). All channels are encoded as a 64 bit float value (per pixel).
* NRGBAF32 - Color and RGB image with _ordinary alpha_ (non premultiplied). All channels are encoded as a 32 bit float value (per pixel).
* RGBAF64 - Color and RGB image with _premultiplied alpha_. All channels are encoded as a 64 bit float value (per pixel).
* RGBAF32 - Color and RGB image with _premultiplied alpha_. All channels are encoded as a 32 bit float value (per pixel).

It is not a requirement by the license, but if you do improve the code then any feedback or pull request is very appreciated. Sharing is caring.

== Dependencies

Nope. No exotic dependencies to mention.

This library applies to the vanilla images as provided by the standard go library `image`.

== Example

Have look at the test example that renders a float image with float RGBA values in the range [0.0, 1.0] and then saves it as a common image.Image.

== TODO

* A common FloatColor interface with functions for add, sub and mul
* NewXXX functions for both float colors and float images.
* A "min-max range" for float colors and for float images.
** Function to check if all values are in valid range both for float color and for float image.
** Function to clamp all values both in float color but also in float image
** RGBA() conversion functions should be based on the min-max range and not [0.0, 1.0]
